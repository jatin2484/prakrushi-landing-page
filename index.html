🌱 Our Story
Prakrushi is an informal initiative supported by Sristi Innovations, a not-for-profit organisation.
 
Clean produce begins long before it reaches the kitchen — in the soil, in patience, and in honest effort.
 
Today, many families want produce they can trust, and many farmers want to farm responsibly, but both are often unsure whom to rely on. Sristi Innovations exists to quietly bring them together.
 
🌾 What We Do
We walk alongside farmers who follow natural ways of farming based on their own wisdom and experience
We visit farms and look for simple, real signs that show the land is healthy and cared for
These signs come from many years of learning and working closely with farms across regions
 
🌱 How We Support Farmers
we support farmers by connecting them with conscious people who value how produce is grown, not just how it looks. This helps farmers receive fair and better returns for their effort and patience.
 
When farmers see that caring for the land is respected and rewarded, they are encouraged to continue natural farming. This also inspires other farmers nearby to observe, learn, and gradually move toward similar practices.
 
When farmers face challenges, we do not impose rules or give orders. We share practical ideas from our long field experience — only when they suit the land and the situation. Like a honey bee, we gently carry useful learning from one place to another, allowing good practices to spread naturally.
 
Many farmers also prepare value added produce using traditional methods such as stone-ground grains, sun-dried spices, and homemade preserves. We support this heritage while encouraging clean handling and safe preparation, so tradition remains alive, responsible, and meaningful.
 
The larger aim is to support farming livelihoods, protect soil and ecology, and keep farming viable for future generations.
 
🌼 Helping Families Make Conscious Choices
Prakrushi connects families with the story behind their food.
Through simple explanations and open sharing, we help people understand how produce is grown, who grows it, and why it matters. This allows families to make conscious choices — choosing fresh, seasonal, and thoughtfully prepared produce that aligns with their values.
Like the Honey Bee Network philosophy, Sristi Innovations acts as a quiet connector, allowing trust and learning to flow naturally between farmers and families.
